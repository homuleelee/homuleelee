Hiii the name’s <b>Lily</b>, a recent pharmacy graduate who likes to draw, roleplay, and play games during my free time. I am very lowkey in energy but once you get to know me, you’ll see that I’m just a goofy bean :p

My <b>discord</b> is usually reserved for friends but I will also give it out to mutuals I’ve spoken with if asked. Please note that I am <i>very slow</i> at responding to discord messages unless you are one of my closest friends. I’m also very <i>forgetful</I> so please don’t take it close to heart if I don’t respond in a timely fashion.

In regards to <b>Ponytown</b>: 
I don't roleplay. I also don't do shippy interactions unless you’re a close friend of mine! But I am open to cuddles and small chat with pretty much anyone even if I may be very shy.
